/* Patch by sandu@lungu.info on 1.08.2010 */
1) Cake 1.3 compatible (use webroot instead of vendors for image assets)
2) PluginName.ClassName::method(params) calls now supported (see Interactive::__getClass($className) method)

/* About */
This plugin adds easy interactions with your CakePHP app using the console or through a custom panel for the CakePHP DebugKit.  
It handles simple PHP commands, SQL queries and PHP using your Cake objects.

/* Examples */
10 % 4 (returns 2)
is_array(49) (returns false)
SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'test@test.com' (retuns the id of the matching record)
User::findByEmail('test@test.com') (returns the entire matching user record)

/* Power Usage */
When using in the DebugKit panel you can stack commands, just make sure to end each with a ";" as you would in your code.

If you're having trouble getting results for a particular command and can't figure out why try turning on debug as the first command:
Configure::write('debug', 2);
User::findByEmail('test@test.com');

/* Warning */
There isn't any sort of error detection or validation on the input.  Also there isn't any pagination for long result sets.  If you enter in a query that returns a million records, you're going to get a million records.

You can't declare a variable and use it across commands. For example this doesn't work:
$i = 10;
$i ++;

/* Instructions */
1) Download the plugin to /app/plugin/interactive

/* Console Instructions */
1) Run the cake console passing the "interactive" shell
   from /app: ../cake/console/cake interactive

2) Enter commands as needed.  Enter 'Q' to exit.  

3) You can also commands as parameters.  The interactive shell will run the command and exit
   ../cake/console/cake interactive Post::find('first')
   
/* DebugKit Instructions (version 1.1) */
1) You need to patch the DebugKit to include the fix for defect #21 (http://thechaw.com/debug_kit/tickets/view/21).
   The fix is 3 additional lines to /plugins/debug_kit/controllers/components/toolbar.php
   http://thechaw.com/debug_kit/commits/view/ba5a45f930e3f2b65cf779155c65048c660110c5
   
2) In your AppController include the panel (as well as all the default panels):
   var $components = array('DebugKit.Toolbar' => array('history', 'session', 'request', 'sqlLog', 'timer', 'log', 'variables', 'Interactive.interactive');

/* DebugKit Instructions (trunk) */
1) Include the panel:
   $components = array('DebugKit.Toolbar' => array('panels' => array('Interactive.interactive'));
