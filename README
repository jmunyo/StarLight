StarLight should be seen as an extension library for CakePHP.

It is organized in the form of a cake application (/app) that can be extended using specialy crafted cake plugins (/app/extensions).
It is ment to be seen as a skeleton application/CMS that can be easily extended to fit needs of Web 2.0 applications.

StarLight core features:
* Written in PHP5, using cake convetions and with lots of phpdoc comments;
* Auto installer and database schema, both present;
* Optimized cookie and session handling (no DB support for now) accessible during bootstrap;
* Extended configuration class with runtime persistence, inheritance, context-awareness and i10n support;
* Themes, plugins, autoloaded configurations and hooks - all supported;
* Pheme - a simple template engine with support for runtime local/global skinning and i10n;
* With jQuery out-of-box (JS forms validation is just one of the features);
* Automagic content delivery network (CDN) support (both StarLight and for 3rd party) for JS libraries;
* 100% compatible with native cake plugins (any 3rd party plugin should work and can be easily converted to an extension, see DebugKit as an example).

Core extensions:
* Api - Bridge to 3rd party web services
* Auth - Security stuff, ACL and user accounts management;
* Cms - Basic content management: articles organized in a tree fashion (nodes), tags (that can be grouped), images, uploads, contact forms, navigation and blocks;
* DebugKit - 3rd party debugging plugin (automagically activates and detects the presence of Interactive plugin).
